# ToDoList_Swift

A Swift implementation of TechLead's todolist-ios (Obj-C) app: https://github.com/techleadhd/todolist-ios

The functionalities are exactly the same. The UI has been modified a bit.

## Minor differences:
- Used multiple sections of 1 item instead of 1 section of multiple items.
- Delete logic is different as a result.
- Other UI nuances.

## From TechLead's README:
Sample todolist app iOS application with IGListKit, Yoga Layout, Material Design.
